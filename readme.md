solving the birthday problem with python

> _from wikipedia:_ In probability theory, the birthday problem (also called birthday paradox) asks for the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, at least two will share a birthday. The birthday problem is that, counterintuitively, the probability of a shared birthday exceeds 50% in a group of only 23 people.
